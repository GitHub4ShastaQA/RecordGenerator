NAME
       genRecord − Generate test data

SYNOPSIS
               genRecord −c configFile.yaml −o database.sqlite:tableName −n 50

DESCRIPTION
       This program is for generating test data. It takes the given config file
       and uses it to generate records of data.

       The config file is a yaml file that contains an array of field
       definitions. In general the field definitions consist of an array that
       contains a field name or array of field names, a generator name, and
       arguments to the generator. The fields are generated in the order that
       they are specified. The results of earlier fields are accesible for use
       as arguments to later generators. They are accessed using the $
       notation where $fieldName is replaced with the value of the field.
